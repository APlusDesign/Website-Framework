Version 0.14


/*********************************/
/* Installation in 7 easy steps */
/*******************************/


1. Download and unzip the Website Framework package, if you haven't already.

2. Create a database for Website Framework on your web server, as well as a MySQL user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it. For more detailed descriptions on creating a database please see. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBz2lG_jm-A)

3. In your phpMyAdmin run the MySQL below 

--
-- Table structure for table `users`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
  `user_id` int(7) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(15) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(35) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `activated` int(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `confirmation` varchar(35) NOT NULL,
  `reg_date` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `last_login` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `group_id` int(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',
  PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=0 ;


4. Open '_code/config.inc.php' in a text editor and fill in the fields marked with XXXXXXXXX including your database details. More detailed instruction can be found here (www.website-framwork.com/config) 

5. Upload the Website Framework files into the root directory of your web server (e.g. http://example.com/)

6. Browse to http://example.com/

7. Enjoy!


Guess that is really only 6 steps ;)
